# Feature: Task Scheduling Simulator
## Goal
    - showcase round-robin, preemptive, and cooperative scheduling with multiple tasks
## Features
    - create multiple tasks with different priorities
        - 3 task functions:
            1. Low Priority 
            2. Medium Priority
            3. High Priority
    - use `vTaskDelay()` and `vTaskDelayUntil()` to demonstrate time-based scheduling
    - log task activity to show how the scheduler works
